A Non-Government Organization (NGO) wants to prepare a database for
all its projects. 
It has diverse head offices in several countries which take
manage and coordinate the projects of that country.

On head offices, an identifier, the city and country where it is located, its
address, a phone number and the name of the director are stored. 

Every head office manages a set of projects, with a code, a title, dates of beginning
and end, the assigned budget and the name of the person in charge. 

One project is formed by a set of actions that can affect to several cities.

We want to know what actions are realised in each city, storing its name,
country and no of inhabitants. 

We also need an identifier to differentiate them. 

Also there is wished the investment of the project that corresponds to the city and a small description of the action.
